# OWCS EMEA Stage 2 Analysis (2025)

This project analyzes Overwatch Champion Series (OWCS) EMEA Stage 2 match data using PostgreSQL and Python.

## Project Structure



```

## Key Insights

- Team map and match win rates (per phase)
- Hero pick and ban rates
- Hero win rates (min 10 games)
- Player average performance (damage, healing, elims)
- Saudi team head-to-head win tracking

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL 15
- Python 3.10
  - pandas
  - seaborn
  - matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Run all SQL in `match_data_analysis.sql` on a PostgreSQL database with `match_data_raw` table.
2. Copy the SQL query results (as CSV or DataFrame) into `owcs_analysis.py` as needed.
3. Run the Python script:

```bash
python owcs_analysis.py
```

Charts will be viewed in VSCode not saved.

## Example Visuals

- Team win rates by phase
- Top 20 banned heroes
- Team map winrate
- Most frequent hero switches

## Key Data Insights

- **Hero Win Rates**  
  *Pharah* led with the highest map win rate (68.8%), followed by *Kiriko* (64.3%) and *Symmetra* (61.8%) showing their strong impact when picked.

- **Most Banned Heroes**  
  *Lucio* (29 bans), *D.Va* (23), and *Freja* (19) were the most banned heroes, reflecting their high strategic threat across both team comps and tempo control.
  *Junkerqueen* remained either under-picked or had low win rates suggesting their minimal impact in EMEA Stage 2 until playoffs where the hero got a buff which caused bans to happen.

- **Versatility by Role**  
  *Skai* (Support), *Pak* (DPS), and *Heesung* (Tank) demonstrated the highest flexibility, each playing **9 unique heroes** a key trait in dynamic matchups.

- **Team Performance by Phase**  
  *Al Qadsiah* maintained a perfect **100% win rate** across both Regular Season and Playoffs. *Twisted Minds* followed with a strong 71.4% in the Regular Season.

## Data Collection Notes

- Matches are counted from the moment **“Assemble Heroes” starts**, not when the team fight begins.
- Switches made **at the last second to touch the objective** are only counted **if the team won the fight**. Otherwise, they’re ignored.
- **Symmetra (for TP)** and **Lucio (for speed)** used only briefly at the start are **not counted as starting heroes**, unless they were used in the first fight.
- All match data was gathered from **[OW Esports YouTube VODs](https://www.youtube.com/@ow_esports)**.
- Final scoreboard verification was done using **[ObsSojourn VODs](https://www.youtube.com/@ObsSojourn)**.
